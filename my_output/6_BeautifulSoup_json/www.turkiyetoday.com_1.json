(Photo via UNESCO) A symbol of resilience and heritage The Al-Hadba Minaret, originally built by the Seljuk Atabeg Nur al-Din Mahmud Zengi in the 12th century, was one of Mosul‚Äôs most iconic structures. Standing at 45 meters tall, its distinct leaning form earned it the nickname ‚Äúthe hunchback‚Äù due to its slant. The minaret was part of the larger Al-Nouri Mosque complex, another historical monument that was severely damaged during the 2017 battle for Mosul. During Daesh‚Äôs occupation of the city, the minaret was blown up as part of the group‚Äôs efforts to erase Iraq‚Äôs cultural heritage. The destruction of the Al-Hadba Minaret was a tragic event for the residents of Mosul and Iraq as a whole, as it symbolized the loss of a centuries-old piece of history.

The project involved thorough structural, geological, and archaeological studies to ensure that the minaret would be rebuilt to its original specifications. The restoration also included stabilization and preservation of the remaining parts of the minaret‚Äôs base. Local Moslawi experts, including engineers, archaeologists, architects, and geologists, played a key role in the planning and execution of the restoration. The project also involved consultations with local authorities and the people of Mosul to ensure that the rebuilding process reflected their wishes and historical significance. A few weeks before the official inauguration, @AAzoulay was in #Mosul today to mark a historic moment: after 6 years of reconstruction, the city‚Äôs iconic monuments are rising again. More than rebuilding, this is about restoring identity, culture & hope.
